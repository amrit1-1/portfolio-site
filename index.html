            <p>Hi! I’m a creative problem-solver with a passion for blending technology and design to create engaging digital experiences.</p>

            <p>My journey into tech started with a natural curiosity for how things work as I saw the tech team at John Lewis operate during my role as a makeup artist for Bobbi Brown. It grew into a full-stack coding bootcamp, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy finding inspiration in the world around me—whether it’s through travel, photography, or innovative ideas in everyday life. I bring a unique perspective shaped by my diverse background, from capturing photos and managing crowds at Madame Tussaud’s to organising luxury beauty events, all of which taught me how to think on my feet and work collaboratively.</p>

            <p>I’m drawn to web development as it combines my love for creativity and technology in a way that makes an impact. Having tailored products and services to customers in the past, I enjoy delivering a quality experience to people who explore my web applications. The idea of building intuitive, accessible websites that people interact with daily excites me. My background in coding, paired with my drive to continually learn and grow, makes this a natural fit. I love the challenge of solving complex problems, turning ideas into functional designs, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible online.</p>

                <p>The button below takes you to my code for the current page you're viewing. It shows how I have coded my personal portfolio website using no external libraries, simply HTML, CSS and vanilla javaScript.</p>

                </a>
                <p>Sale Snatchers is a fun game I created using HTML, CSS and Javascript with no external libraries. The user has to move the trolley to catch the falling items, collecting as many 'savings' as they can in 60s. There are also some game-changing special items that the user should grab, and some they should avoid.</p>
